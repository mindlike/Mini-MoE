This script is a fairly flexible method for configuring Python scripts through command line arguments or external configuration files. The main use case would be when running a Python script such as 'train.py', where a user might want to tweak values of certain variables specified in the file for different runs, without modifying the 'train.py' file each time. 

This script receives arguments given in the command line when you run your main code (like 'train.py'). It then modifies global variables in the file accordingly. The modifying process could either be done by reading a python file that contains the variables and their values, or by giving the variables and their values directly in the command line. 

Let's break it down:

1. The script first iterates through all supplied arguments.
2. For each argument, it checks if it contains an equals sign '='. 
  - If there's no '=', it assumes the argument is the path to an external configuration file, it opens the file, prints its content, and executes it in the current global context (using exec()) so it will override any variables declared in that file with the same names as in the current file.
  - If a '=', it strips away the prefix '--', and divides the argument into a key-value pair. It expects these arguments to be used to directly modify existing global variables.
3. For key-value pairs (direct modifications), it tries to interpret the value in the pair using literal_eval(), which is safer than eval() which evaluates the string as a Python expression. For example, a 'key=value' argument would result in the global variable 'key' being assigned to 'value'.
  - This step handles different data types. If the value can be parsed as a Python datatype, it will be used as such; otherwise, it's used as a string.
4. If the key being modified doesn't exist in globals(), a ValueError will be raised. This is a safety mechanism in case a user tries to set a variable that doesn't exist, the script can fail gracefully.

Please note when using this script that it allows arbitrary execution of Python code and could potentially be dangerous if unchecked. 

This script is mainly designed to simplify the configuration process for Python scripts without a lot of boilerplate code, and keeping the user freedom of modifying variables as seen suitable.
